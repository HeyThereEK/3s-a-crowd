# 3's a Crowd
We made three games and a game engine throughout the semester, two deviating from our plan, but fun nonetheless. Our games include: a Chrome dinosaur clone, a multiplayer racing runner, and a Flappy Bird clone

## LocaThePug
This is a single-player runner in which you avoid the road signs or lose. If you hit one, you restart the game. Use the up-arrow key to jump.

We used the Platformer code as a template for our first game. We gave the player a fixed velocity and direction. The signs are doors, but you go to the start of the level if you touch one.

## MudFight
This is a multiplayer runner. There are mud puddles on the floor, which slow you down. Use W for one player and the up-arrow key for the other one. The first person to the end wins the race!

We used the LocaThePug code as a template for this second game. We added a new player and custom controls for both, and the mud puddles are sections in which, on contact, the player is slowed down. 

## Flaily Snail
This game is an easy-mode clone of flappy bird but with a snail. There is animations associated with jumping and moving, and if the snail touches the bottom obstacles it is teleported back to the start. 

The jump timer was removed to allow for infinite jumps. When the player reaches the end they beat the game. There was more potential for procedural generation here.
