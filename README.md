# 3's a Crowd
We made three games and a game engine throughout the semester, two deviating from our plan, but fun nonetheless. Our games include: a Chrome dinosaur clone, a multiplayer racing runner, and a Flappy Bird clone

## LocaThePug
This is a single-player runner in which you avoid the road signs or lose. If you hit one, you restart the game. Use the up-arrow key to jump.

We used the Platformer code as a template for our first game. We gave the player a fixed velocity and direction. The signs are doors, but you go to the start of the level if you touch one.

## MudFight
This is a multiplayer runner. There are mud puddles on the floor, which slow you down. Use W for one player and the up-arrow key for the other one. The first person to the end wins the race!

We used the LocaThePug code as a template for this second game. We added a new player and custom controls for both, and the mud puddles are sections in which, on contact, the player is slowed down. 

## Flappy Bird
