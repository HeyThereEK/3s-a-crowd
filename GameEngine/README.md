# Platformer Game

In this project we're also looking to add features to an existing game.  This time around, we're adding animation and physics (and collision!).

Pick any four of these additions:

* Add acceleration to x movement, add animation for walking
* Add gravity + jumping + animation for jumping and falling
* Add collision with terrain and enemies (like last time!)
* Add enemy behavior (moving left for a time, then moving right, or randomly flipping direction with small probability, or whatever) and animate enemy
* Add attack animation and attacking (like last time!)
* Add damage-taking and health and temporary invulnerability (like last time!)
* Refactor the game into an entity-component system (a la Unity or Bevy); you can use the `hecs` crate for this
